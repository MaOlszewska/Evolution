# The evolution of the world 

This simulation shows what is happening with the world during the evolution.
Animals try to survive by eating grass and reproducing. Behavior of animals depends on genes. You can observe this process on charts and statistics for each map.
What is more, you can also indicate the animal whose positions and history you want to know. When the simulation is finished, you can find statistic saved in the files.

- Elephant has more than 75% start energy
- Giraffe has 50-75% start energy
- Cat has 25-50% start energy
- Mouse has 0-25% start energy

The animal that is being tracked is under a magnifying glass.
